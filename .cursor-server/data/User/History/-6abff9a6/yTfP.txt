- nethogs-collector          # nethogs process bandwidth collector
- suricata-collector         # suricata IDS/IPS collector

Processing Services:
- ai-5min-aggregator.service # AI data aggregation service
- ai-5min-aggregator.timer   # AI data aggregation timer (runs every 5 minutes)
- device-tracker             # Device tracking service
- unified-device-processor   # Unified device processing service
- iot-security-scanner       # IoT security scanning service
- device-scorer.service      # Device security scoring service
- device-scorer.timer        # Device security scoring timer
- enhanced-alert-system      # Enhanced alert system service

Web Services:
- flask-dashboard            # Main web interface (may not be systemd service)

PYTHON SCRIPTS (Use with: pgrep -f <script-name> or pkill -f <script-name>)
============================================================================

Processing Scripts:
- ai_5min_aggregator.py      # AI analysis script
- device_tracker.py          # Device tracking script
- unified_device_processor.py # Device processing script
- iot_security_scanner.py    # IoT scanning script
- device_scorer.py           # Security scoring script
- enhanced_alert_system.py   # Alert management script

COMMON COMMANDS
===============

Check Service Status:
systemctl status <service-name>

Start Service:
sudo systemctl start <service-name>

Stop Service:
sudo systemctl stop <service-name>

Restart Service:
sudo systemctl restart <service-name>

Enable Service (auto-start on boot):
sudo systemctl enable <service-name>

Disable Service:
sudo systemctl disable <service-name>

Check if Script is Running:
pgrep -f <script-name>

Stop Script:
pkill -f <script-name>

Check All NetGuard Services:
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep -E "(p0f|tshark|tcpdump|ngrep|httpry|argus|netsniff|iftop|nethogs|suricata|ai|device|iot|enhanced)"

Check Timer Services:
systemctl list-timers | grep -E "(ai|device)"

Check AI Aggregator Specifically:
systemctl status ai-5min-aggregator.timer
systemctl status ai-5min-aggregator.service

NOTES
=====
- Some services may be timers (.timer) instead of regular services (.service)
- Flask dashboard runs as a Python process, not a systemd service
- Use 'systemctl list-timers' to check timer-based services
- Scripts are Python processes that can be managed with pgrep/pkill
