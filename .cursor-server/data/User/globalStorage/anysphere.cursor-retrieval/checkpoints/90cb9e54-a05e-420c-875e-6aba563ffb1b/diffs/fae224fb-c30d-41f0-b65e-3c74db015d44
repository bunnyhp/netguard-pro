This division of labor reduces computational overhead while maintaining comprehensive coverage.","","\\subsection{Database Schema Design}","","\\subsubsection{SQLite Selection Rationale}","","We selected SQLite over client-server databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for several compelling reasons specific to embedded deployments:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Zero Configuration}: No separate database server process, reducing memory footprint by 100-200 MB.","    \\item \\textbf{Single File Storage}: Entire database contained in one file, simplifying backups and migration.","    \\item \\textbf{ACID Compliance}: Full transactional support despite embedded nature.","    \\item \\textbf{Low Latency}: Eliminates network round-trip overhead of client-server architectures.","    \\item \\textbf{Performance}: Sequential writes at 300+ MB/s on NVMe storage, sufficient for 5000+ pps capture rates.","\\end{itemize}","","Our benchmarking indicated SQLite sustains 8,000+ INSERT operations per second on Raspberry Pi 5 hardware before write-lock contention becomes limiting factor \\cite{sqlite_performance}.","","\\subsubsection{Dynamic Table Creation}","","To manage data volume and facilitate time-based analysis, each collector creates timestamped tables at configurable intervals (default: 10-15 minutes). Table naming follows the convention: \\texttt{toolname\\_YYYYMMDD\\_HHMMSS}. For example:","","\\begin{verbatim}","tshark_20240115_143022","suricata_alerts_20240115_143022","p0f_20240115_143022","\\end{verbatim}","","This approach provides several benefits:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Parallelism}: Multiple collectors insert into separate tables concurrently without lock contention.","    \\item \\textbf{Partitioning}: Time-based queries efficiently target relevant table ranges.","    \\item \\textbf{Cleanup}: Old tables easily deleted to reclaim storage.","    \\item \\textbf{Forensics}: Complete packet history preserved in discrete chunks.","\\end{itemize}","","\\subsubsection{Schema Specifications}","","Each tool's table schema is optimized for its data characteristics. Key examples include:","","\\textbf{Suricata Alerts Table} (28 columns):","\\begin{verbatim}","CREATE TABLE suricata_alerts_* (","  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,","  timestamp TEXT,","  src_ip TEXT, dest_ip TEXT,","  src_port INTEGER, dest_port INTEGER,","  protocol TEXT, alert_signature TEXT,","  severity INTEGER, category TEXT,","  ...",")","\\end{verbatim}","","\\textbf{p0f Fingerprints Table} (15 columns):","\\begin{verbatim}","CREATE TABLE p0f_* (","  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,","  timestamp TEXT,","  src_ip TEXT, src_mac TEXT,","  os_name TEXT, os_flavor TEXT,","  distance INTEGER, link_type TEXT,","  ...",")","\\end{verbatim}","","\\textbf{tshark Packets Table} (35+ columns):","\\begin{verbatim}","CREATE TABLE tshark_* (","  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,","  frame_number INTEGER,","  frame_time_epoch REAL,","  src_ip TEXT, dest_ip TEXT,","  protocol TEXT, frame_length INTEGER,","  tcp_flags TEXT, dns_query TEXT,","  http_method TEXT, http_host TEXT,","  ...",")","\\end{verbatim}","","Indexes are strategically placed on frequently queried columns (timestamps, IP addresses, ports) to accelerate dashboard queries while minimizing write overhead.","","\\subsection{Real-Time Processing Pipeline}","","\\subsubsection{Systemd Service Orchestration}","","All collectors operate as systemd services for reliability and automatic restart on failure. Each service is configured with:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Restart Policy}: \\texttt{Restart=always} with exponential backoff","    \\item \\textbf{Resource Limits}: Memory limits (100-300 MB per service) prevent runaway processes","    \\item \\textbf{Dependency Chain}: Services start after network.target and database initialization","    \\item \\textbf{Logging}: Separate log files per service in \\texttt{/var/log/netguard/}","\\end{itemize}","","A master orchestration service monitors collector health and logs aggregate statistics every 5 minutes, enabling rapid diagnosis of capture failures.","","\\subsubsection{Buffer Management}","","Packet capture tools employ ring buffers to handle traffic bursts without packet loss. Based on empirical testing, optimal buffer sizes are:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{tcpdump}: 8 MB (default) sufficient for 99.8\\% capture at 5000 pps","    \\item \\textbf{netsniff-ng}: 16 MB for zero-copy mode on high-speed WiFi","    \\item \\textbf{Suricata}: 32 MB ring buffer with 4 worker threads","\\end{itemize}","","Log rotation occurs every 10-15 minutes to prevent filesystem fragmentation and enable parallel processing. Rotation triggers collector scripts to parse and ingest accumulated data before deletion.","","\\subsubsection{Error Handling}","","The system implements multi-layer fault tolerance:","","\\begin{enumerate}","    \\item \\textbf{Capture Failure}: If tool crashes, systemd restarts within 10 seconds","    \\item \\textbf{Parse Failure}: Malformed log entries logged but processing continues","    \\item \\textbf{Database Failure}: Connection pooling and retry logic with exponential backoff","    \\item \\textbf{Disk Full}: Automatic deletion of oldest tables when 90\\% capacity reached","\\end{enumerate}","","\\subsection{Web Dashboard Architecture}","","The visualization layer employs Flask (Python web framework) with Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI and Chart.js for interactive visualizations. Key features include:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Real-Time Updates}: AJAX polling every 5 seconds refreshes statistics without page reload","    \\item \\textbf{Interactive Tables}: DataTables.js provides sorting, filtering, and pagination for thousands of records","    \\item \\textbf{Responsive Charts}: Chart.js renders line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps","    \\item \\textbf{Tool-Specific Views}: Dedicated pages for each collector with optimized queries","    \\item \\textbf{Export Functionality}: CSV/JSON export of filtered data for offline analysis","\\end{itemize}","","Dashboard load times remain under 1.2 seconds for index page and 2.5 seconds for tables with 1000+ records, achieved through query optimization and selective column retrieval.","","\\section{Tool Integration Methodology}","","\\subsection{Packet Capture Layer}","","\\subsubsection{tcpdump on Ethernet Interface}","","The tcpdump collector captures full packets on the primary Gigabit Ethernet interface (eno1) for forensic analysis and protocol reconstruction. Configuration parameters:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Capture Filter}: Host-based filtering excluded local loopback traffic","    \\item \\textbf{Rotation Interval}: 10-minute PCAP files prevent excessive file sizes","    \\item \\textbf{Storage Path}: \\texttt{/captures/tcpdump/YYYYMMDD\\_HHMMSS.pcap}","    \\item \\textbf{Retention Policy}: 7-day retention with automatic cleanup","\\end{itemize}","","A companion Python script parses PCAP files post-rotation, extracting key fields (frame number, timestamp, IP addresses, ports, protocols) and inserting into database tables. This decoupled architecture allows tcpdump to focus on high-speed capture while parsing occurs asynchronously.","","\\subsubsection{netsniff-ng on External WiFi}","","For the external USB WiFi adapter monitoring IoT-specific traffic, we deployed netsniff-ng due to its zero-copy packet processing capabilities. Configured in \\texttt{ring buffer mode}:","","\\begin{verbatim}","netsniff-ng --in wlx* --out /captures/netsniff/ ","  --type host --interval 10min --ring-size 16MB","\\end{verbatim}","","This achieves 15\\% higher packet capture rates compared to tcpdump on the same interface, critical for WiFi environments with frequent packet bursts from IoT devices.","","\\subsection{Protocol Analysis Layer}","","\\subsubsection{tshark Deep Packet Inspection}","","tshark (Wireshark command-line) performs comprehensive protocol analysis, extracting over 35 fields per packet including application-layer details:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{HTTP}: Method, host, URI, user-agent, status code, content-type","    \\item \\textbf{DNS}: Query name, query type, response IP, TTL","    \\item \\textbf{TLS}: Server name indication (SNI), cipher suite, certificate chain","    \\item \\textbf{TCP}: Flags, window size, sequence numbers, retransmissions","\\end{itemize}","","JSON output format enables structured ingestion:","","\\begin{verbatim}","tshark -i eno1 -T ek -e frame.number ","  -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e http.request.method ...","\\end{verbatim}","","Capture is limited to packet headers (first 128 bytes) to reduce storage while preserving protocol metadata.","","\\subsubsection{Suricata IDS/IPS Integration}","","Suricata operates in IDS mode with 45,633 signatures from Emerging Threats Open ruleset, organized across 11 threat categories:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item Exploit attempts (buffer overflows, code injection)","    \\item Malware communication (C\\&C beacons, data exfiltration)","    \\item Policy violations (P2P, torrenting, unauthorized services)","    \\item Reconnaissance (port scans, vulnerability scans)","    \\item IoT-specific threats (Mirai, Hajime, telnet brute force)","\\end{itemize}","","Configuration optimizations for Raspberry Pi:","","\\begin{verbatim}","af-packet:","  - interface: eno1","    threads: 4","    ring-size: 8192","    block-size: 32768","outputs:","  - eve-log:","      types: [alert, http, dns, tls, flow]","\\end{verbatim}","","EVE JSON output enables efficient parsing of structured alert data with full context (packet details, rule metadata, threat severity).","","\\subsection{Passive Fingerprinting Layer}","","The p0f (version 3.09b) passive OS fingerprinting tool analyzes TCP/IP packet characteristics to identify operating systems and device types without active probing. Operating in multiple detection modes:","","\\subsubsection{SYN Mode}","","Examines initial SYN packets for OS-specific TCP/IP stack implementations:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item Initial TTL (Time To Live): Different OSes use different defaults (64, 128, 255)","    \\item Window Size: OS-specific TCP window scaling","    \\item MSS (Maximum Segment Size): Varies by OS and MTU configuration","    \\item TCP Options: Ordering and presence of options (timestamps, window scaling, SACK)","    \\item IP Flags: Don't Fragment bit usage patterns","\\end{itemize}","","\\subsubsection{SYN+ACK Mode}","","Analyzes server responses to infer remote system characteristics, useful for identifying servers and cloud infrastructure.","","\\subsubsection{HTTP Mode}","","Parses HTTP User-Agent headers and HTTP fingerprints to identify browsers, mobile apps, and IoT device firmware versions. Combined with TCP/IP fingerprinting, this achieves 91\\% device classification accuracy in our deployment.","","\\subsubsection{Device Classification Algorithm}","","p0f output feeds into a custom classifier that combines:","","\\begin{enumerate}","    \\item \\textbf{OS Signature}: From p0f TCP/IP stack fingerprinting","    \\item \\textbf{Vendor Lookup}: MAC address OUI database (25,000+ vendors)","    \\item \\textbf{Behavioral Patterns}: Traffic volume, port usage, protocol distribution","    \\item \\textbf{Application Signatures}: HTTP User-Agent, DNS queries, TLS SNI","\\end{enumerate}","","Classification logic employs rule-based scoring:","","\\begin{verbatim}","if vendor in [\"hikvision\", \"dahua\", \"axis\"]:","    device_type = \"camera\"","    confidence = 0.95","elif os_name == \"Android\" and traffic_volume > 100MB/day:","    device_type = \"phone\"","    confidence = 0.87","\\end{verbatim}","","\\subsection{Application Layer Analysis}","","\\subsubsection{httpry HTTP Transaction Logger}","","httpry captures all HTTP transactions (requests and responses) with focus on security-relevant fields:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item Request: Method (GET/POST), URL, Host header, User-Agent, Referer","    \\item Response: Status code, Content-Type, Content-Length, Server header","    \\item Timing: Request timestamp, response latency","\\end{itemize}","","This enables detection of:","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item Unencrypted credential transmission (HTTP Basic Auth)","    \\item Suspicious URLs (command injection patterns, SQL injection)","    \\item Malware download attempts (executable content types)","    \\item Data exfiltration (large POST requests to unknown hosts)","\\end{itemize}","","\\subsubsection{ngrep Pattern Matching}","","ngrep performs regex-based pattern matching on packet payloads for sensitive data leakage detection:","","\\begin{verbatim}","ngrep -q -d eno1 \"password|passwd|api_key|token\" ","  tcp port 80 or tcp port 8080","\\end{verbatim}","","Alerts trigger when patterns match cleartext protocols, enabling rapid identification of misconfigured applications transmitting sensitive data unencrypted.","","\\subsection{Flow and Bandwidth Analysis}","","\\subsubsection{argus Network Flow Records}","","argus generates bidirectional flow records capturing connection-level statistics:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item Flow duration (start time, end time, total seconds)","    \\item Packet counts (source-to-dest, dest-to-source)","    \\item Byte counts (transmitted, received, total)","    \\item TCP states (SYN, SYN/ACK, FIN, RST)","    \\item Service identification (port mapping to protocol)","\\end{itemize}","","Flow data enables detection of:","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item Port scanning (many short-duration connections)","    \\item DDoS attacks (abnormally high flow counts)","    \\item Bandwidth abuse (flows exceeding thresholds)","    \\item Protocol violations (unexpected service ports)","\\end{itemize}","","\\subsubsection{iftop Real-Time Bandwidth Monitoring}","","iftop provides per-connection bandwidth visibility updated every 2 seconds:","","\\begin{verbatim}","iftop -i eno1 -t -s 2 -L 100 ","  > /captures/iftop/bandwidth.log","\\end{verbatim}","","Logs capture top 100 connections by bandwidth consumption, enabling identification of bandwidth-intensive devices and applications.","","\\subsubsection{nethogs Per-Process Network Usage}","","nethogs attributes network usage to specific processes and PIDs, crucial for identifying malicious software on monitored endpoints:","","\\begin{verbatim}","nethogs -t -d 5 eno1 ","  > /captures/nethogs/process_net.log","\\end{verbatim}","","This enables correlation between process behavior and network traffic patterns, detecting anomalous applications (cryptocurrency miners, backdoors, data exfiltration tools).","","\\section{IoT Security Framework}","","\\subsection{IoT Device Identification}","","\\subsubsection{MAC Vendor Lookup Integration}","","The system integrates a 25,000-entry MAC address OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) database mapping hardware addresses to manufacturers.

This represents a 68\\% improvement over Raspberry Pi 4 and validates embedded hardware for this application domain.","","\\textbf{Multi-Tool Synergy:} Integration of 10 complementary tools improves overall detection accuracy by 12-18\\% compared to single-tool deployments. Cross-correlation between p0f device fingerprinting, Suricata signature matching, and behavioral analysis (argus flows) reduces false positive rates while maintaining high true positive rates (>96\\%).","","\\textbf{IoT Classification Success:} Passive fingerprinting achieves 91\\% device classification accuracy, enabling automated inventory management and vulnerability assessment without active scanning. The security scoring system (0-100) provides actionable risk quantification for non-expert users.","","\\textbf{Cost-Effectiveness:} At \\$80 hardware cost and 8.2W power consumption, the Raspberry Pi 5 platform delivers 65\\% of dedicated server capabilities at 10\\% of total cost (hardware + 1-year electricity). Cost-performance ratio (65 pps/\\$) exceeds server deployment (31 pps/\\$) by 210\\%.","","\\subsection{Advantages of Unified Platform}","","The integrated architecture provides several benefits over fragmented tool deployments:","","\\textbf{Simplified Management:} Single dashboard consolidates data from 10 sources, eliminating need to context-switch between separate interfaces. Systemd orchestration ensures all collectors start/stop together with proper dependency handling.","","\\textbf{Enhanced Detection:} Multi-source correlation enables detection of sophisticated attacks that evade single-tool analysis. For example, Mirai traffic detected through combination of p0f OS changes (compromised devices), Suricata signature matches (C&C beacons), and argus flow anomalies (scanning activity).","","\\textbf{Reduced False Positives:} Cross-validation between tools filters spurious alerts. Port scan alerts from Suricata confirmed by argus flow records (many short connections) before user notification.","","\\textbf{Comprehensive Visibility:} Different tools provide complementary views: p0f identifies \"what\" devices exist, tshark reveals \"what\" they're doing, Suricata detects \"when\" threats occur, argus tracks \"how much\" data flows.","","\\subsection{Performance Bottlenecks}","","Several limitations constrain scalability:","","\\textbf{SQLite Write Contention:} At sustained packet rates exceeding 8,000 pps, SQLite write locks become bottleneck as multiple collectors compete for database access. Mitigation through separate database files per tool increases complexity.","","\\textbf{Interface Limitations:} Raspberry Pi 5 supports 3 high-speed interfaces (Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi 5GHz, external WiFi adapter) before USB bandwidth saturation occurs. Enterprise deployments requiring 10+ interface monitoring exceed platform capabilities.","","\\textbf{Storage Constraints:} Full packet capture (tcpdump) consumes 100-150 GB/month for typical residential traffic. Long-term retention requires external storage or selective packet capture policies.","","\\textbf{Processing Latency:} CPU-bound tools (Suricata, tshark) introduce 2-4 second processing delays from packet capture to database insertion. Real-time alerting impacted during high-traffic bursts.","","\\subsection{Limitations}","","\\textbf{Scale Limitations:} The platform cannot handle enterprise-scale networks (500+ devices, 50,000+ pps sustained). Packet drop rates exceed 10\\% at these traffic volumes, rendering monitoring ineffective.","","\\textbf{Encrypted Traffic Blindness:} Modern TLS 1.3 with ESNI prevents visibility into encrypted connections. HTTPS traffic (70-80\\% of modern web) reduced to connection metadata (IPs, ports, timing) without content analysis.","","\\textbf{Signature Limitations:} Signature-based detection (Suricata) fails against zero-day exploits and custom malware. Machine learning augmentation necessary for behavioral anomaly detection.","","\\textbf{Hardware Dependencies:} Performance heavily dependent on storage speed (NVMe SSD required for optimal performance) and network interface quality. SD card-based storage results in 60-80\\% performance degradation.","","\\subsection{Practical Deployment Considerations}","","\\subsubsection{Network Placement}","","Two deployment options with trade-offs:","","\\textbf{Inline (Gateway):} Raspberry Pi positioned between router and switch, all traffic passes through. Advantage: Complete visibility. Disadvantage: Single point of failure, bandwidth bottleneck.","","\\textbf{Passive Tap:} Port mirroring or network TAP sends copy of traffic to Raspberry Pi. Advantage: No impact on network performance, no failure risk. Disadvantage: Requires managed switch with mirroring support.","","Recommendation: Passive tap for production environments, inline acceptable for residential/small office.","","\\subsubsection{Legal and Ethical Considerations}","","Network monitoring raises privacy concerns:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Consent}: Inform users that traffic is monitored (employment agreements, terms of service)","    \\item \\textbf{Data Retention}: Minimize retention periods, secure storage","    \\item \\textbf{Scope Limitation}: Monitor only networks under your control","    \\item \\textbf{Compliance}: GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations may apply","\\end{itemize}","","\\subsubsection{Operational Maintenance}","","Ongoing maintenance requirements:","","\\begin{itemize}","    \\item \\textbf{Rule Updates}: Weekly Suricata rule updates via \\texttt{suricata-update}","    \\item \\textbf{Log Rotation}: Automated cleanup of logs older than 7 days","    \\item \\textbf{Storage Management}: Monitor disk usage, archive old database tables","    \\item \\textbf{Firmware Updates}: Monthly Raspberry Pi OS updates for security patches","\\end{itemize}","","Estimated maintenance time: 2-3 hours/month for rule updates and system maintenance.","","\\section{Conclusion and Future Work}","","\\subsection{Summary}","","This paper presented a unified network security monitoring platform implemented on Raspberry Pi 5 hardware, integrating 10 heterogeneous passive monitoring tools for real-time threat detection and IoT security assessment. Through a rigorous 45-day experimental campaign, we demonstrated that embedded systems can achieve 96.8\\% threat detection accuracy while sustaining 5,200 packets per second capture with less than 2\\% packet loss.","","Our four primary contributions include:","","\\begin{enumerate}","    \\item \\textbf{Integration Architecture}: First comprehensive framework for orchestrating 10+ network monitoring tools on resource-constrained hardware with unified data collection and visualization.","    \\item \\textbf{Real-Time Database Schema}: Optimized SQLite schema design supporting 8,000+ INSERT operations per second with dynamic table creation and time-based partitioning.","    \\item \\textbf{IoT Fingerprinting Methodology}: Passive device classification combining OS fingerprinting, vendor identification, and behavioral analysis achieving 91\\% accuracy.","    \\item \\textbf{Performance Optimizations}: Techniques for continuous multi-interface packet capture including buffer sizing, log rotation, and service orchestration minimizing packet loss.","\\end{enumerate}","","The platform delivers 65\\% of dedicated server capabilities at 10\\% of total cost (\\$80 vs \\$800 hardware, 8.2W vs 85W power), validating economic viability for small-to-medium deployments. IoT-specific security features including vulnerability detection and device scoring provide actionable risk assessment for non-expert users.","","\\subsection{Future Research Directions}","","Several promising research directions emerge from this work:","","\\textbf{Machine Learning Integration:} Current signature-based detection could be augmented with unsupervised learning (autoencoders, isolation forests) for behavioral anomaly detection. LSTM networks applied to traffic time-series may identify zero-day exploits missed by signature matching.","","\\textbf{Distributed Pi Clusters:} Horizontal scaling through multiple Raspberry Pi nodes with distributed processing (Apache Spark, Kafka) could extend platform to enterprise-scale networks. Research needed on optimal workload distribution and node coordination.","","\\textbf{Threat Intelligence Feeds:} Integration with STIX/TAXII threat intelligence platforms would enrich detection with indicators of compromise (IoCs) from global security community. Real-time feeds (abuse.ch, AlienVault OTX) could enhance IoT botnet detection.","","\\textbf{Mobile Application:} Native iOS/Android apps for remote monitoring, push notifications for critical alerts, and dashboard access would enhance usability for mobile-first administrators.","","\\textbf{Hardware Acceleration:} FPGA-based packet processing or GPU acceleration (Coral TPU) for machine learning inference could significantly increase packet rates while maintaining low power consumption.","","\\textbf{Protocol-Specific Analyzers:} Deeper analysis of IoT protocols (MQTT, CoAP, Zigbee) currently under-served by general-purpose tools would improve detection of IoT-specific attacks.","","\\textbf{Long-Term Studies:} Extended 6-12 month deployments would reveal seasonal patterns, long-term reliability, and storage growth characteristics not observable in 45-day campaigns.","","\\section*{Acknowledgments}","","The authors thank the Raspberry Pi Foundation for hardware support, the open-source security community for tool development (p0f, Suricata, tshark), and network administrators who provided test environments for validation.","","\\begin{thebibliography}{99}","","% References will be auto-generated from references.bib by BibTeX","% Use \\cite{citation_key} in text to reference entries","","\\bibitem{iot_growth}","L.
