System Health Page Updates:","- ✅ Added `ai-5min-aggregator.timer` and `ai-5min-aggregator.service`","- ✅ Added `device-scorer.timer` and `device-scorer.service`","- ✅ Added all missing services from `/home/jarvis/NetGuard/services/`","- ✅ Updated service detection logic","","### 2. AI Dashboard API Endpoints:","- ✅ `/ai-dashboard/api/stats` - Real AI analysis data","- ✅ `/ai-dashboard/api/network-devices` - Real device data (separate from primary AI)","- ✅ `/ai-dashboard/api/threat-timeline` - Real threat timeline","- ✅ `/ai-dashboard/api/device-activity` - Real device activity","- ✅ `/ai-dashboard/api/protocol-distribution` - Real protocol data","- ✅ `/ai-dashboard/api/health-history` - Real health history","","### 3. Data Flow Verification:","- ✅ AI Aggregator collects from all 10 tools + Suricata","- ✅ Sends comprehensive data to Gemini AI","- ✅ Stores results in `ai_analysis` table","- ✅ Dashboard now reads from real AI analysis data","","## 🚀 Commands to Fix:","","```bash","# 1.
